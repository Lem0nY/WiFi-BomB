### What is WIFI BOMB

This is a program originally thought of as a headless pi operation. I (bigz3y), wanted to create something that would automate the attack on multiple netowrks without the ened of a display, or to be in the physical proximity of the attack location. THis was designed to be able to capture networks on a mass scale without any user interaction (other than installation obviously).

### How it works
